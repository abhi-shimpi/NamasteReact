        components so when user clicks on say contact then browser just loads that Contact component and 
        does not make  Network call only to fetch that page.
    -server side - In server side routing , say we have home page,contact page, about page 
        Now when we want to go to contact page then browser will make an API call to fetch that page from 
        server. It will refresh whole page.
