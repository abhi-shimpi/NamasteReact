1. Order of Links of scripts in index.html matters alot 
    They should be 
    1.react.development
    2.react-dom.development
    3.script.js

2.createElement is an object with tag(name of tag), attribute and children
3.render method creates a html of given object and puts up that html into root .
    It replaces everything within root div .
    It does not appends but replaces .

4.ReactElement(object) => HTML(Browser Understands)

5.React is just js library and we can apply or use react anywhere on website like 
    only in header or only in footer just by render a react element into that class or id.
    - Anything other than that class or id will be applicable 
      LIKE we in oure code only targetting root element but code other than root element can be applicable 
      which can be on top or below of root element.
    -Like this react gives us freedom to use it anywhere in code base unlike framework where whole package comes 
     and we need to use that package.

                React.createElement(
                    "h1",
                    {id:"heading"},
                    "I am h1 tag of child1!"
                ),
                React.createElement(
                    "h1",
                    {id:"heading"},
                    "I am h1 tag of child2!"
                )
    ]
    In createElement method if we want more than one child then we can use array.

7.There are two CDN links 
    1. for development
    2. Production

8. Use of crossorigin - In ReactJS, Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) refers to the method that 
    allows you to make requests to the server deployed at a different domain.
     As a reference, if the frontend and backend are at two different domains, we need CORS there.
