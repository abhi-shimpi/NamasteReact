1.What is JSX 
    -JSX stands for JavaScript and XML
    -JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like markup inside a JavaScript file.
    -JSX is allows you to write html like syntax in react which at the end create React Element.
    -JSX is an extension of js language based on ES6 and is translated into regular js code at runtime.

2.SuperPowers of JSX
-It is faster than normal JavaScript as it performs optimizations while translating to regular JavaScript.
-It allows to html like syntax to create react element which makes code more readable.
-As JSX is an expression, we can use it inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, 
    accept it as arguments, or return it from functions.
-Component -> React uses divides web-page into component . So JSX which is combination of js and html make code 
                more reusable across the web-app.

3. Type in script -
    -The type attribute of the <script> element indicates the type of script represented by the element: 
        a classic script, an import map, a JavaScript module, speculation rules, or a data block.
4.Difference
    -{TitleComponent} can be react element or variable.

    -{<TitleComponent/>} - This is a self-closing tag or a "void element" in JSX. It is used when you have a component 
        that doesn't have any children or content to place between opening and closing tags.This is often used for stateless 
        functional components or components that don't need any children.

    -{<TitleComponent><TitleComponent/>} - This is a regular opening and closing tag, and it is used when your component needs 
        to enclose other JSX elements or components within it. 
        <Title>
            <h1>My Title</h1>
        </Title>
    -Both of these syntaxes ultimately create a React component,
