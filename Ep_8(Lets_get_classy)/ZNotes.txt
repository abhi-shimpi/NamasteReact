1.Class Based Components(old way to create component) but asked alot in interviews.

2.A functional component is JS function which returns JSX .

3.A class Based component is a class which exrends React.component and which has render method which returns a JSX.

4.Why we use super(props)?

5.When we are loading functional component that means we are calling that function.
  When we are laoding class based component that means we are creating instance of that class.And once instance is created 
   imidiately construcor will be called.

6.Never update state variable like this
    this.state.count = this.state.count + 1;

7.this.state = {
    count : 0,
    count2 : 1
}

this.setState({count:2}) -> so here it will only update passed variable value and will not update other 
                            state variables.

8.Life cycle method -
    Parent construcor called
    Parent render called
    Child constructor called
    Child render called
    Child componentDidMount called
    Parent componentDidMount called

    - So the above flow reflects the aproach two 
      Loads component -> Renders its JSX -> Make API call into componentDidMount -> Re-render component with data

    - We always make API call in componentDidMount because componentDidMount is called atlast after we render our component
        onto DOM so it makes user not to wait for API call to get response and loads the the respective component 
        onto DOM. This follows the approach of 

        Loads component -> Renders its JSX -> Make API call into componentDidMount -> Re-render component with data

    -Mounting means putting elements into DOM

9.Refer to Lifecycle diagram 
  - React lifecycle is divided into two phases 
        1.Render phases - 
            - In Render phase , construcor and render method will be called for 
                1.parent 
                2.child 1 then child 2 .....for every child
            -React batches render phase of all children together.
            -WHY react is doing that ? Why it is batching render phase of all Children together?
                -because in render phase it will trigger reconciallition algorithm by diffing between 
                    two VDOM and finalizing VDOM.
                -As in next phase actual DOM will get updated and updation of atual DOM is very expensive task.
                -So in render phase itself react diff algo finalizes VDOM to update actual DOM.
        2.Commit phase -
            -In commit phase,
                1.actaul DOM will get updated 
                2.componentDidMount will get called for all children like child 1 , child 2, child 3....etc.
                3.componentDidMount will get called for parent.
            -Commit phase takes a time as it envolves updation of actual DOM.

        eg. -
        1.Render Phase
            Parent construcor called
            Parent render called
            First class Child constructor called
            First class Child render called
            Second class Child constructor called
            Second class Child render called
        2.Commit phase
            First class Child componentDidMount called
            Second class Child componentDidMount called
            Parent componentDidMount called
