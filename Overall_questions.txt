1.Is there need of parcel in react?
2.Can we use parcel in normal html,css js ?










Notes----------------->
1.While passing props , name of props on left side in parent component
    should be same as name of reciving props in child component.Name of 
    data on right side which is an arguments can be same , not mandatory.

2.We can also do two way data passing in react like we did in SearchComponent.
    where we are passing a function as props form parent component and reciving 
    that function child comp as props then doing some action and passing a argument 
    to that function which get received in same function(like onSearchRest) in
    parent component.
