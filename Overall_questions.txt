1.Is there need of parcel in react?
2.Can we use parcel in normal html,css js ?










Notes----------------->
1.While passing props , name of props on left side in parent component
    should be same as name of reciving props in child component.Name of 
    data on right side which is an arguments can be same , not mandatory.

2.We can also do two way data passing in react like we did in SearchComponent.
    where we are passing a function as props form parent component and reciving 
    that function child comp as props then doing some action and passing a argument 
    to that function which get received in same function(like onSearchRest) in
    parent component.

3.Flow of component render 
   
   1.Component get called from its parent
   2.Component's JSX get returned 
   3.useEffect get called 

   Remember the two approaches 
   1.Loads -> API(wait for API to fetch data) -> render component with data
   2.Loads -> Render -> API (make API call and fetch data) -> Render component with data

4.You should follow SRP. That your component should only one responsibility.
    -Like CardContainer has only one responsibility of showing card data.
    -But what i was doing in MenuItems previously that i am looping over data in component itself so this 
        MenuItems can't be reused by Cart component for showing item data.
        Insted i should do mapping over items in parent component and pass a object to MenuItems component.
        This increases reusability.
    -So keep in mind that whenever you need to do mapping in component itself , check if same mapping can 
     be done in parent of that component or not.
