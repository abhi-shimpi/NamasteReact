1. What is NPM 
    NPM is js package manager which manages all packages used by js 

2.What is Parcel 
    Parcel is a js bundler which is used by react to convert js, html, css , images and all assets in a single file to optimise 
    your code and to lesser http requests

    we need parcel for -
    a. optimization
    b. Lazy Loading
    c. Minification
    d. Tree Shaking
    e. Faster builds
    f. Differential bundling

3.parcel-cache 
    parcel-cache contains binary files which contains metadata of builds which help in reducing time for further builds.

4.npx
    npx is used to execute any package

5.Difference between depenceies and devDependencies
    -depenceies contains those packages which are required for production environment.
    -These depenceies are used for executing and testing the code on localhost.
    -These are installed by running the command 
        npm install -D <depenceies>
    
    -While devDependencies contains those packages which are used for development purpose.
    -These are not used for executing and testing code .
    - These are installed by running the command 
        npm install <devDependencies>

6.Tree shaking 
    - It means removing the unnecessary code and spaces from code to optimise the code.

7.Hot Module Replacement
    -HMR means parcel has c++ algorithm which detects changes in our code reflect those changes 
        intermediately after saving them on localhost.

9..gitignore 
    This file is used to add those files of project which should not be pushed on github.
    -We should add files like node_modules , parcel cache, dist ... etc files which can be 
        recreated.
    -We should not add files packag.json and package-lock.json

10.package.json vs. package-lock.json 
    -package.json is a configuration for all packages required in project
    -It contains metaData of all dependencies along with metadata of project like name , author ,discription etc.

    -package-lock.json is a file which maintains exact version of all dependencies required within project.
    -It assures that versions of all dependencies and their subdependencies should be same across all environments.
    -Also when user 1 share his code base to user 2 its package-lock.json that maintains same of versions of all packages 
        across both users and avoids version conflicts and errors.

11.Not Modifying `package-lock.json
    -As package-lock.json is created by npm and it maintains exact version of all dependencies, so any changes in
    package-lock.json can lead to inconsistency and conflicts due version of dependencies.

12.What is node_modules 
    -node_modules contains the data of all dependencies which are mentioned in the package-lock.json file.
    -We should not push node_modules on git as them can be recreated by whenever required with help of package-lock.json.

13.Dist folder
    -dist folder contains build of our project which is served to browser
    -It contains single html , css and js file of whole code .

14.BrowsersList 
    -In this list we can mention the version of browser on which our app should run.

15. ^ and ~
    - ^ is used for minor update 
    - ~ is used for patch and bug fixes update
